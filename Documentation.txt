***Workflow

    ->We assume, we have one client at the moment.
    ->Client instructs employees to download app from playstore.
    ->Employees register themselves and login.
    ->Once logined, they can send friend request/invetation to other colleges.
    ->The recieving end of the friend request can accept or delete the friend request.
    ->Once recieving end of the friend request accepts the request, they both can have conversation.
    ->At present, thers's only one group, where all employees can message.

***Features

    ->One-to-One messages are sent at real time,and the conversation is stored in database.
    ->Friend Request Notification is sent and recieved at realtime.
    ->Group Messages are sent in realtime
    ->Accept/Deny Friend Request
    ->View Sent/Recieved Friend Request

***Bugs

    ->Scenario:
        Three users: User-One, User-Two, User-Three 
        User-One and User-Two are having a conversation.
        If User-Three sends message to User-Two User-One can also see that message.

    ->Need to Encapsulate One-to-One Chat, so no third person recieves their message.
    ->Same with Group Chat
